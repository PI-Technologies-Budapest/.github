# *π Technologies is an innovative startup that creates precise intelligent stages*

> *The π stage is a multipurpose precise, intelligent stage. Our stages can be controlled over a USB cable with a serial communication API, or with our innovative UI app. You can get it as a preassembled tool, or you can assemble it yourself based on our description and you can integrate it into any kind of laboratory or workshop environment. It’s ideal for microscopes, optical laboratories, manufacturing, DIY labs, etc.*


👩‍💻 In our repositories you can find the APIs, documentation that you need for the development, and sometimes example codes, also sometimes the executables.
